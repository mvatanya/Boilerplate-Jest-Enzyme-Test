/** NOTE: Every create-react-app comes with one smoke test for App.js using Jest 
 
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import App from './App';

      const div = document.createElement('div');
      ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
      ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
    });

  If using Enzyme it will look like this:

    import React from "react";
    import { shallow } from "enzyme";
    import App from "./App";

    it("renders without crashing", function() {
      shallow(<App />);
    });
